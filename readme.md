# Project Title: ETF Recommendation Engine

## Approach and Challenges

Initially, official APIs and web scraping techniques were considered for data collection. However, due to the difficulty of accessing official fund manager/ third party APIs, cost considerations (only premium features on third party sources have ETF data), and ethical concerns, a simplier and alternative approach was adopted using OpenAI's GPT-4.
