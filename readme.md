# Project Title: ETF Recommendation Engine

## Approach and Challenges

Initially, official APIs and web scraping techniques were considered for data collection. However, due to the difficulty of accessing official fund manager/ third party APIs, cost considerations (only premium features on third party sources have ETF data), and ethical concerns, a simplier and alternative approach was adopted using OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Prompts**: Tailored prompts based on investor profiles, sector preferences, geographic regions, and asset classes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enables quick and efficient exploration of ETF options.
- **Ethical Compliance**: Ensures adherence to ethical standards in data usage.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with official APIs for real-time data.
- Enhanced analytics and visualization tools.
